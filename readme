What does open source mean?
Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessibleâ€”anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. ... Open source has become a movement and a way of working that reaches beyond software production.

you can find the code at https://commando.neodymiumdevelopmentlabs.repl.co/files its a bit yanked together at the moment due to the random spike of members but a site and a better looking repo is coming very soon!
